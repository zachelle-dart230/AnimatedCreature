    My goal with this aimated drawing was to display a confused face, someone buzzing with thoughts all the time everyday. The animation of the white spots filling in the black background at the top is representive of when a new thing that you just rember that you have to do pops up into your head. I made the black eyes move with the mouse function to also represnt the reaction to these thoughts occuring.<br>
